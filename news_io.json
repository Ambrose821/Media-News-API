      "description": "A brutal conflict in Europe was fresh in people’s minds and the race for the White House turned ugly as talk of secret societies and corruption roiled the United States. It was 1800, and conspiracy theories were flourishing across America. Partisan newspapers spread tales of European elites seeking to seize control of the young democracy. Preachers in New England warned of plots to abolish Christianity in favor of godlessness and depravity. This bogeyman of the early republic was the Illuminati, a secret organization founded in Germany dedicated to free thinking and opposed to religious dogma. Despite the Illuminati’s lack of real influence in America, conspiracy theorists imagined the group’s fingerprints were everywhere. They said Illuminati manipulation had caused France’s Reign of Terror, the wave of executions and persecutions the followed the French Revolution. They feared something similar in America. From the witch trials in Salem, Massachusetts, to fears of the Illuminati, from the Red Scare to the John Birch Society to QAnon, conspiracy theories have served as dark counterprogramming to the American story taught in history books. If a healthy democracy relies on the trust of its citizens, then conspiracy theories show what happens when that trust begins to fray. Change a few details, add in a pizza parlor, and the hysteria surrounding the Illuminati sounds a lot like QAnon, the contemporary conspiracy theory that claims a powerful cabal of child-sacrificing satanists secretly shapes world events. Like the Illuminati craze, QAnon emerged at a time of uncertainty, polarization and distrust. “The more things change, the more things seem to come back,” said Jon Graham, a writer and translator based in Vermont who is an expert on the Illuminati and the claims that have surrounded the group for centuries. “There’s the mainstream narrative of history. And then there’s the other narrative — the alternative explanations for history — that never really goes away.” US & World News Capitol Riot Dec 16, 2022 QAnon Believer Who Chased Officer Inside Capitol Sentenced to 5 Years in Prison Jan. 6 Hearing Jun 21, 2022 QAnon Shaman Seen In Video of Protesters Illegally Entering Arizona House Building Just like today, these bizarre stories often reveal deeply rooted anxieties focused on racial and religious strife and technological and economic change. The most persistent conspiracy theories can survive on the fringes for decades, before suddenly reappearing with new details, villains and heroes, often at a time of social upheaval or economic dislocation. Sometimes, these beliefs can erupt into action, as they did on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of President Donald Trump’s supporters broke into the U.S. Capitol. In America’s early days, the villain was the Illuminati. Created in 1776, the group was part of a fad of supposedly secret societies that became fashionable in Europe. It was defunct by 1800 and had no presence in the U.S. Still, claims spread that Illuminati agents were working undercover to take over the federal government, outlaw Christianity and promote sexual promiscuity and devil worship among the young. The theory was picked up by the Federalist Party and played a key part of 1800 presidential race between President John Adams, a Federalist, and Vice President Thomas Jefferson, a Democratic-Republican. Rumors circulated among Federalists that Jefferson was an atheist who would hand America over to France if elected president. Jefferson did win, and the Federalists never fully recovered. Tales of the illuminati receded, but soon the Freemasons emerged to take their place in the wild imaginings of early Americans. The Freemasons counted many leading figures, including George Washington, as members. Their influence fueled whispers that suggested the fraternal organization was a satanic conspiracy bent on ruling the world. To understand why so many were convinced, it’s important to remember the anxiety that followed the American Revolution, said Jonathan Den Hartog, a historian at Samford University. Many people were unsure whether the country would last. “Living through this period, a lot of people were very nervous. And when there’s uncertainty and fear, people are going to cast about for explanations,” Den Hartog said. Both the Illuminati and the Freemasonscontinue to make appearances in conspiracy theories even today. The middle of the 19th century also saw thousands of Americans join new religious movements during the Second Great Awakening. One popular group, the Millerites, was founded by William Miller, a veteran of the War of 1812 who used numeric clues in the Bible to calculate the ending of the world: Oct. 22, 1844. Before the appointed day, many of Miller’s followers sold or gave away their possessions, donned white clothing and headed for high land — in some parts of Massachusetts they climbed trees on the highest hills — so as to hasten their reunion with God. When Oct. 22 passed, they came down from the hills. Some returned to their old lives. Others insisted the End had come, only invisibly. “It was called the ‘Great Disappointment,'” said J. Gordon Melton, a Baylor University historian and Millerite expert. “A lot of people were very disappointed — Miller included. But others just said, ‘Well, they just got the date wrong.’” In the News Alex Jones Oct 20, 2023 Judge rules Alex Jones can't use bankruptcy protection to avoid paying Sandy Hook families The belief that the world will soon end — or that a new era will dawn — shows up again and again in popular conspiracy theories. QAnon adherents have long predicted a “Great Awakening” that will occur, following “the storm,” when former President Trump triumphs and his enemies — including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and actor Tom Hanks — are exposed and possibly executed on television. Many dates have been suggested for this final, bloody victory, predictions that are later shrugged off when proved incorrect. In 2021, thousands of QAnon believers gathered in Dallas after one of their leaders predicted the return John F. Kennedy Jr., who features prominently in QAnon lore despite his death in 1999. Crestfallen believers later decided they had their dates wrong. Something similar happened late last year, when many conspiracy theorists claimed a long-planned test of the emergency broadcast system would activate chemicals contained within COVID-19 vaccines. Those who got the shot would be killed or perhaps turned into zombies, according to this thinking. It didn’t happen. The assassination of President John F. Kennedy, along with the Vietnam War and Watergate, later set the stage for our current era of “alternative facts” by convincing large groups of Americans that they could no longer trust their own government. Today’s conspiracy theories reflect that same distrust, and an unease with the rapid pace of economic, technological and environmental change. Think of claims that the 1969 moon landing was faked, that the government covered up evidence of extraterrestrials, or that the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were an inside job. Fears about 5G wireless towers or vaccines containing microchips, to use two newer examples, reflect fears of government control and new technologies. Claims that climate change is a lie offer an easy answer to a complicated, existential threat caused by people’s own behavior. Then there’s the coronavirus pandemic, which created ideal conditions for conspiracy theories: widespread fear and economic uncertainty, a deadly threat that emerged mysteriously from a geopolitical adversary, swiftly created vaccines, and a controversial government response. “COVID really cranked all the dials to 11,” said Joseph Uscinski, a University of Miami political scientist who studies belief in conspiracy theories. The internet has made belief in conspiracy theories more visible and shareable. Trump and other politicians have learned how to exploit belief in conspiracy theories for their own ends. But history shows America has withstood hoaxes, conspiracy theories and cycles of distrust before. Den Hartog, the Samford historian, said he would like to believe the nation can do it again. “This gives me some hope, to know that we’ve had problems and we weathered them,” he said. “There is an American capacity to take a breath, to try harder on our civic life and to rebuild trust.”",

It was defunct by 1800 and had no presence in the U.S. Still, claims spread that Illuminati agents were working undercover to take over the federal government, outlaw Christianity and promote sexual promiscuity and devil worship among the young. The theory was picked up by the Federalist Party and played a key part of 1800 presidential race between President John Adams, a Federalist, and Vice President Thomas Jefferson, a Democratic-Republican. Rumors circulated among Federalists that Jefferson was an atheist who would hand America over to France if elected president. Jefferson did win, and the Federalists never fully recovered. Tales of the illuminati receded, but soon the Freemasons emerged to take their place in the wild imaginings of early Americans. The Freemasons counted many leading figures, including George Washington, as members. Their influence fueled whispers that suggested the fraternal organization was a satanic conspiracy bent on ruling the world. To understand why so many were convinced, it’s important to remember the anxiety that followed the American Revolution, said Jonathan Den Hartog, a historian at Samford University. Many people were unsure whether the country would last. “Living through this period, a lot of people were very nervous. And when there’s uncertainty and fear, people are going to cast about for explanations,” Den Hartog said. Both the Illuminati and the Freemasonscontinue to make appearances in conspiracy theories even today. The middle of the 19th century also saw thousands of Americans join new religious movements during the Second Great Awakening. One popular group, the Millerites, was founded by William Miller, a veteran of the War of 1812 who used numeric clues in the Bible to calculate the ending of the world: Oct. 22, 1844. Before the appointed day, many of Miller’s followers sold or gave away their possessions, donned white clothing and headed for high land — in some parts of Massachusetts they climbed trees on the highest hills — so as to hasten their reunion with God. When Oct. 22 passed, they came down from the hills. Some returned to their old lives. Others insisted the End had come, only invisibly. “It was called the ‘Great Disappointment,'” said J. Gordon Melton, a Baylor University historian and Millerite expert. “A lot of people were very disappointed — Miller included. But others just said, ‘Well, they just got the date wrong.’” In the News Alex Jones Oct 20, 2023 Judge rules Alex Jones can't use bankruptcy protection to avoid paying Sandy Hook families The belief that the world will soon end — or that a new era will dawn — shows up again and again in popular conspiracy theories. QAnon adherents have long predicted a “Great Awakening” that will occur, following “the storm,” when former President Trump triumphs and his enemies — including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and actor Tom Hanks — are exposed and possibly executed on television. Many dates have been suggested for this final, bloody victory, predictions that are later shrugged off when proved incorrect.

Those who got the shot would be killed or perhaps turned into zombies, according to this thinking. It didn’t happen. The assassination of President John F. Kennedy, along with the Vietnam War and Watergate, later set the stage for our current era of “alternative facts” by convincing large groups of Americans that they could no longer trust their own government. Today’s conspiracy theories reflect that same distrust, and an unease with the rapid pace of economic, technological and environmental change. Think of claims that the 1969 moon landing was faked, that the government covered up evidence of extraterrestrials, or that the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were an inside job. Fears about 5G wireless towers or vaccines containing microchips, to use two newer examples, reflect fears of government control and new technologies. Claims that climate change is a lie offer an easy answer to a complicated, existential threat caused by people’s own behavior. Then there’s the coronavirus pandemic, which created ideal conditions for conspiracy theories: widespread fear and economic uncertainty, a deadly threat that emerged mysteriously from a geopolitical adversary, swiftly created vaccines, and a controversial government response. “COVID really cranked all the dials to 11,” said Joseph Uscinski, a University of Miami political scientist who studies belief in conspiracy theories. The internet has made belief in conspiracy theories more visible and shareable. Trump and other politicians have learned how to exploit belief in conspiracy theories for their own ends. But history shows America has withstood hoaxes, conspiracy theories and cycles of distrust before. Den Hartog, the Samford historian, said he would like to believe the nation can do it again. “This gives me some hope, to know that we’ve had problems and we weathered them,” he said. “There is an American capacity to take a breath, to try harder on our civic life and to rebuild trust.”",

      "description": "Part of the Navy’s Executive Engagement Visit and Navy Talent and Acquisition Group Pacific By Asi Andrew Fa’asauandrew@samoanews.com Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA — Josephine Tauoa, who has etched her name in the history books of the United States Navy as the first Samoan to be promoted to the rank of Command Master Chief, is currently on-island as part of the Navy’s Executive Engagement Visit program. The program aims to bring senior leaders back to their hometowns to talk about their career and opportunities, engage with community leaders, and raise the profile of the Navy. Command Master Chief Tauoa will also be participating in recruiting centered activities as part of an effort by Navy Talent and Acquisition Group Pacific which will be ongoing until February 8th. Women’s coalition of Am. Samoa is holding a meet and greet today, February 01, 2024 at Paradise Pizza. Meet Commander Master chief Josie Tauoa, the first Samoan woman in her role as third-in-command on the Navy vessel USS Chung-Hoon. Sponsored by DYWA. RSVP at seu.wcas@gmail.com. [courtesy photo] On Tuesday evening, CMDMC Tauoa was the guest speaker at a special Athletes Dinner hosted by the American Samoa National Olympics Committee (ASNOC) at the Good Vibes Restaurant in Tafuna, where she shared her inspiring journey of hard work and perseverance that led her to her current position. The event was attended by ASNOC executives, presidents and officials of various local sports organizations, coaches, athletes and parents. CMDMC Tauoa highlighted three attributes which she said will help anyone who pursues a goal in the military, sports and life in general. “Accountability, a sense of belonging and commitment,” she revealed. “Accountability we kind of shy away from sometimes because we don’t want to be responsible for the members of your team. But you have to stop and think what would happen to your team if you are not well prepared for whatever you’re training for. “So you have to make sure you go the extra mile to prepare yourself to help your team, as they are no doubt preparing. In other words, you are accountable not only to yourself but to the whole team whether you’re a leader or a team member. “Secondly, a sense of belonging is very important for all of us to understand that you want to be a part of that team, and you want to make everyone in that team feel like they belong and they’re a part of you. “And thirdly, if you’re going to make a commitment to be a part of this team, you have to understand that everything that you give is going to contribute to the success of the team. “So these three things put together constitute the mindset that I had as I worked my way up the ranks in the military. It can also work for you if you’re in sports or in everyday life.” Hailing from the village of Faga’itua, she began her education at Alofau Elementary School and continued at Faga’itua High School where she graduated in 1996. After graduation, she enlisted into the Navy that same year and graduated from her “A” school as a Machinist Mate. She has served on numerous surface ships including USS Coronado, USS Emory S. Land, USS Ronald Reagan, USS Bonhomme Richard, USS Halsey, and most recently as the Command Master Chief of USS Chung Hoon. She currently serves as the Command Master Chief for the Pacific Fleet Commander in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. She stated that her 27-year career had been a long and sometimes lonely journey where she had to overcome obstacles and challenges. “My initial job as a mechanic was very challenging having to work in a male dominated environment,” she recalled. “There was obviously no one who looked like me, both female and Samoan. But I pushed myself with the belief that I can do whatever those other sailors were doing and with God’s guidance, I prevailed.” CMDMC Tauoa stated that she strives to be the best she can be so that the younger generations of Samoan females who join the Navy have someone to look up to and hopefully emulate. She also expressed her gratitude for the support and prayers of families and friends for the sons and daughters of American Samoa in the military. While on-island, CMDMC Tauoa will be assisting another daughter of American Samoa Navy Recruiter Nofo Alesana in her recruiting efforts. Alesana is a member of Manumalo High School Class of 2012 and she told Samoa News that she hopes to recruit more females from the Territory. The recruitment drive will conclude on February 8th.

      "description": "A brutal conflict in Europe was fresh in people’s minds and the race for the White House turned ugly as talk of secret societies and corruption roiled the United States. It was 1800, and conspiracy theories were flourishing across America. Partisan newspapers spread tales of European elites seeking to seize control of the young democracy. Preachers in New England warned of plots to abolish Christianity in favor of godlessness and depravity. This bogeyman of the early republic was the Illuminati, a secret organization founded in Germany dedicated to free thinking and opposed to religious dogma. Despite the Illuminati’s lack of real influence in America, conspiracy theorists imagined the group’s fingerprints were everywhere. They said Illuminati manipulation had caused France’s Reign of Terror, the wave of executions and persecutions the followed the French Revolution. They feared something similar in America. From the witch trials in Salem, Massachusetts, to fears of the Illuminati, from the Red Scare to the John Birch Society to QAnon, conspiracy theories have served as dark counterprogramming to the American story taught in history books. If a healthy democracy relies on the trust of its citizens, then conspiracy theories show what happens when that trust begins to fray. Change a few details, add in a pizza parlor, and the hysteria surrounding the Illuminati sounds a lot like QAnon, the contemporary conspiracy theory that claims a powerful cabal of child-sacrificing satanists secretly shapes world events. Like the Illuminati craze, QAnon emerged at a time of uncertainty, polarization and distrust. “The more things change, the more things seem to come back,” said Jon Graham, a writer and translator based in Vermont who is an expert on the Illuminati and the claims that have surrounded the group for centuries. “There’s the mainstream narrative of history. And then there’s the other narrative — the alternative explanations for history — that never really goes away.” US & World News Capitol Riot Dec 16, 2022 QAnon Believer Who Chased Officer Inside Capitol Sentenced to 5 Years in Prison Jan. 6 Hearing Jun 21, 2022 QAnon Shaman Seen In Video of Protesters Illegally Entering Arizona House Building Just like today, these bizarre stories often reveal deeply rooted anxieties focused on racial and religious strife and technological and economic change. The most persistent conspiracy theories can survive on the fringes for decades, before suddenly reappearing with new details, villains and heroes, often at a time of social upheaval or economic dislocation. Sometimes, these beliefs can erupt into action, as they did on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of President Donald Trump’s supporters broke into the U.S. Capitol. In America’s early days, the villain was the Illuminati. Created in 1776, the group was part of a fad of supposedly secret societies that became fashionable in Europe. It was defunct by 1800 and had no presence in the U.S. Still, claims spread that Illuminati agents were working undercover to take over the federal government, outlaw Christianity and promote sexual promiscuity and devil worship among the young. The theory was picked up by the Federalist Party and played a key part of 1800 presidential race between President John Adams, a Federalist, and Vice President Thomas Jefferson, a Democratic-Republican. Rumors circulated among Federalists that Jefferson was an atheist who would hand America over to France if elected president. Jefferson did win, and the Federalists never fully recovered.

      "description": "Part of the Navy’s Executive Engagement Visit and Navy Talent and Acquisition Group Pacific By Asi Andrew Fa’asauandrew@samoanews.com Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA — Josephine Tauoa, who has etched her name in the history books of the United States Navy as the first Samoan to be promoted to the rank of Command Master Chief, is currently on-island as part of the Navy’s Executive Engagement Visit program. The program aims to bring senior leaders back to their hometowns to talk about their career and opportunities, engage with community leaders, and raise the profile of the Navy. Command Master Chief Tauoa will also be participating in recruiting centered activities as part of an effort by Navy Talent and Acquisition Group Pacific which will be ongoing until February 8th. Women’s coalition of Am. Samoa is holding a meet and greet today, February 01, 2024 at Paradise Pizza. Meet Commander Master chief Josie Tauoa, the first Samoan woman in her role as third-in-command on the Navy vessel USS Chung-Hoon. Sponsored by DYWA. RSVP at seu.wcas@gmail.com. [courtesy photo] On Tuesday evening, CMDMC Tauoa was the guest speaker at a special Athletes Dinner hosted by the American Samoa National Olympics Committee (ASNOC) at the Good Vibes Restaurant in Tafuna, where she shared her inspiring journey of hard work and perseverance that led her to her current position. The event was attended by ASNOC executives, presidents and officials of various local sports organizations, coaches, athletes and parents. CMDMC Tauoa highlighted three attributes which she said will help anyone who pursues a goal in the military, sports and life in general. “Accountability, a sense of belonging and commitment,” she revealed. “Accountability we kind of shy away from sometimes because we don’t want to be responsible for the members of your team. But you have to stop and think what would happen to your team if you are not well prepared for whatever you’re training for. “So you have to make sure you go the extra mile to prepare yourself to help your team, as they are no doubt preparing. In other words, you are accountable not only to yourself but to the whole team whether you’re a leader or a team member. “Secondly, a sense of belonging is very important for all of us to understand that you want to be a part of that team, and you want to make everyone in that team feel like they belong and they’re a part of you. “And thirdly, if you’re going to make a commitment to be a part of this team, you have to understand that everything that you give is going to contribute to the success of the team. “So these three things put together constitute the mindset that I had as I worked my way up the ranks in the military. It can also work for you if you’re in sports or in everyday life.” Hailing from the village of Faga’itua, she began her education at Alofau Elementary School and continued at Faga’itua High School where she graduated in 1996. After graduation, she enlisted into the Navy that same year and graduated from her “A” school as a Machinist Mate. She has served on numerous surface ships including USS Coronado, USS Emory S. Land, USS Ronald Reagan, USS Bonhomme Richard, USS Halsey, and most recently as the Command Master Chief of USS Chung Hoon. She currently serves as the Command Master Chief for the Pacific Fleet Commander in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. She stated that her 27-year career had been a long and sometimes lonely journey where she had to overcome obstacles and challenges. “My initial job as a mechanic was very challenging having to work in a male dominated environment,” she recalled. “There was obviously no one who looked like me, both female and Samoan. But I pushed myself with the belief that I can do whatever those other sailors were doing and with God’s guidance, I prevailed.” CMDMC Tauoa stated that she strives to be the best she can be so that the younger generations of Samoan females who join the Navy have someone to look up to and hopefully emulate. She also expressed her gratitude for the support and prayers of families and friends for the sons and daughters of American Samoa in the military. While on-island, CMDMC Tauoa will be assisting another daughter of American Samoa Navy Recruiter Nofo Alesana in her recruiting efforts. Alesana is a member of Manumalo High School Class of 2012 and she told Samoa News that she hopes to recruit more females from the Territory. The recruitment drive will conclude on February 8th.

      "description": "A brutal conflict in Europe was fresh in people’s minds and the race for the White House turned ugly as talk of secret societies and corruption roiled the United States. It was 1800, and conspiracy theories were flourishing across America. Partisan newspapers spread tales of European elites seeking to seize control of the young democracy. Preachers in New England warned of plots to abolish Christianity in favor of godlessness and depravity. This bogeyman of the early republic was the Illuminati, a secret organization founded in Germany dedicated to free thinking and opposed to religious dogma. Despite the Illuminati’s lack of real influence in America, conspiracy theorists imagined the group’s fingerprints were everywhere. They said Illuminati manipulation had caused France’s Reign of Terror, the wave of executions and persecutions the followed the French Revolution. They feared something similar in America. From the witch trials in Salem, Massachusetts, to fears of the Illuminati, from the Red Scare to the John Birch Society to QAnon, conspiracy theories have served as dark counterprogramming to the American story taught in history books. If a healthy democracy relies on the trust of its citizens, then conspiracy theories show what happens when that trust begins to fray. Change a few details, add in a pizza parlor, and the hysteria surrounding the Illuminati sounds a lot like QAnon, the contemporary conspiracy theory that claims a powerful cabal of child-sacrificing satanists secretly shapes world events. Like the Illuminati craze, QAnon emerged at a time of uncertainty, polarization and distrust. “The more things change, the more things seem to come back,” said Jon Graham, a writer and translator based in Vermont who is an expert on the Illuminati and the claims that have surrounded the group for centuries. “There’s the mainstream narrative of history. And then there’s the other narrative — the alternative explanations for history — that never really goes away.” US & World News Capitol Riot Dec 16, 2022 QAnon Believer Who Chased Officer Inside Capitol Sentenced to 5 Years in Prison Jan. 6 Hearing Jun 21, 2022 QAnon Shaman Seen In Video of Protesters Illegally Entering Arizona House Building Just like today, these bizarre stories often reveal deeply rooted anxieties focused on racial and religious strife and technological and economic change. The most persistent conspiracy theories can survive on the fringes for decades, before suddenly reappearing with new details, villains and heroes, often at a time of social upheaval or economic dislocation. Sometimes, these beliefs can erupt into action, as they did on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of President Donald Trump’s supporters broke into the U.S. Capitol. In America’s early days, the villain was the Illuminati. Created in 1776, the group was part of a fad of supposedly secret societies that became fashionable in Europe. It was defunct by 1800 and had no presence in the U.S. Still, claims spread that Illuminati agents were working undercover to take over the federal government, outlaw Christianity and promote sexual promiscuity and devil worship among the young. The theory was picked up by the Federalist Party and played a key part of 1800 presidential race between President John Adams, a Federalist, and Vice President Thomas Jefferson, a Democratic-Republican. Rumors circulated among Federalists that Jefferson was an atheist who would hand America over to France if elected president. Jefferson did win, and the Federalists never fully recovered. Tales of the illuminati receded, but soon the Freemasons emerged to take their place in the wild imaginings of early Americans. The Freemasons counted many leading figures, including George Washington, as members. Their influence fueled whispers that suggested the fraternal organization was a satanic conspiracy bent on ruling the world. To understand why so many were convinced, it’s important to remember the anxiety that followed the American Revolution, said Jonathan Den Hartog, a historian at Samford University. Many people were unsure whether the country would last. “Living through this period, a lot of people were very nervous. And when there’s uncertainty and fear, people are going to cast about for explanations,” Den Hartog said. Both the Illuminati and the Freemasonscontinue to make appearances in conspiracy theories even today. The middle of the 19th century also saw thousands of Americans join new religious movements during the Second Great Awakening. One popular group, the Millerites, was founded by William Miller, a veteran of the War of 1812 who used numeric clues in the Bible to calculate the ending of the world: Oct. 22, 1844. Before the appointed day, many of Miller’s followers sold or gave away their possessions, donned white clothing and headed for high land — in some parts of Massachusetts they climbed trees on the highest hills — so as to hasten their reunion with God. When Oct. 22 passed, they came down from the hills. Some returned to their old lives. Others insisted the End had come, only invisibly. “It was called the ‘Great Disappointment,'” said J. Gordon Melton, a Baylor University historian and Millerite expert. “A lot of people were very disappointed — Miller included. But others just said, ‘Well, they just got the date wrong.’” In the News Alex Jones Oct 20, 2023 Judge rules Alex Jones can't use bankruptcy protection to avoid paying Sandy Hook families The belief that the world will soon end — or that a new era will dawn — shows up again and again in popular conspiracy theories. QAnon adherents have long predicted a “Great Awakening” that will occur, following “the storm,” when former President Trump triumphs and his enemies — including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and actor Tom Hanks — are exposed and possibly executed on television. Many dates have been suggested for this final, bloody victory, predictions that are later shrugged off when proved incorrect. In 2021, thousands of QAnon believers gathered in Dallas after one of their leaders predicted the return John F. Kennedy Jr., who features prominently in QAnon lore despite his death in 1999. Crestfallen believers later decided they had their dates wrong. Something similar happened late last year, when many conspiracy theorists claimed a long-planned test of the emergency broadcast system would activate chemicals contained within COVID-19 vaccines. Those who got the shot would be killed or perhaps turned into zombies, according to this thinking. It didn’t happen. The assassination of President John F. Kennedy, along with the Vietnam War and Watergate, later set the stage for our current era of “alternative facts” by convincing large groups of Americans that they could no longer trust their own government. Today’s conspiracy theories reflect that same distrust, and an unease with the rapid pace of economic, technological and environmental change. Think of claims that the 1969 moon landing was faked, that the government covered up evidence of extraterrestrials, or that the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were an inside job. Fears about 5G wireless towers or vaccines containing microchips, to use two newer examples, reflect fears of government control and new technologies. Claims that climate change is a lie offer an easy answer to a complicated, existential threat caused by people’s own behavior. Then there’s the coronavirus pandemic, which created ideal conditions for conspiracy theories: widespread fear and economic uncertainty, a deadly threat that emerged mysteriously from a geopolitical adversary, swiftly created vaccines, and a controversial government response. “COVID really cranked all the dials to 11,” said Joseph Uscinski, a University of Miami political scientist who studies belief in conspiracy theories. The internet has made belief in conspiracy theories more visible and shareable. Trump and other politicians have learned how to exploit belief in conspiracy theories for their own ends. But history shows America has withstood hoaxes, conspiracy theories and cycles of distrust before. Den Hartog, the Samford historian, said he would like to believe the nation can do it again. “This gives me some hope, to know that we’ve had problems and we weathered them,” he said. “There is an American capacity to take a breath, to try harder on our civic life and to rebuild trust.”",

      "description": "A brutal conflict in Europe was fresh in people’s minds and the race for the White House turned ugly as talk of secret societies and corruption roiled the United States. It was 1800, and conspiracy theories were flourishing across America. Partisan newspapers spread tales of European elites seeking to seize control of the young democracy. Preachers in New England warned of plots to abolish Christianity in favor of godlessness and depravity. This bogeyman of the early republic was the Illuminati, a secret organization founded in Germany dedicated to free thinking and opposed to religious dogma. Despite the Illuminati’s lack of real influence in America, conspiracy theorists imagined the group’s fingerprints were everywhere. They said Illuminati manipulation had caused France’s Reign of Terror, the wave of executions and persecutions the followed the French Revolution. They feared something similar in America. From the witch trials in Salem, Massachusetts, to fears of the Illuminati, from the Red Scare to the John Birch Society to QAnon, conspiracy theories have served as dark counterprogramming to the American story taught in history books. If a healthy democracy relies on the trust of its citizens, then conspiracy theories show what happens when that trust begins to fray. Change a few details, add in a pizza parlor, and the hysteria surrounding the Illuminati sounds a lot like QAnon, the contemporary conspiracy theory that claims a powerful cabal of child-sacrificing satanists secretly shapes world events. Like the Illuminati craze, QAnon emerged at a time of uncertainty, polarization and distrust. “The more things change, the more things seem to come back,” said Jon Graham, a writer and translator based in Vermont who is an expert on the Illuminati and the claims that have surrounded the group for centuries. “There’s the mainstream narrative of history. And then there’s the other narrative — the alternative explanations for history — that never really goes away.” US & World News Capitol Riot Dec 16, 2022 QAnon Believer Who Chased Officer Inside Capitol Sentenced to 5 Years in Prison Jan. 6 Hearing Jun 21, 2022 QAnon Shaman Seen In Video of Protesters Illegally Entering Arizona House Building Just like today, these bizarre stories often reveal deeply rooted anxieties focused on racial and religious strife and technological and economic change. The most persistent conspiracy theories can survive on the fringes for decades, before suddenly reappearing with new details, villains and heroes, often at a time of social upheaval or economic dislocation. Sometimes, these beliefs can erupt into action, as they did on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of President Donald Trump’s supporters broke into the U.S. Capitol. In America’s early days, the villain was the Illuminati. Created in 1776, the group was part of a fad of supposedly secret societies that became fashionable in Europe. It was defunct by 1800 and had no presence in the U.S. Still, claims spread that Illuminati agents were working undercover to take over the federal government, outlaw Christianity and promote sexual promiscuity and devil worship among the young. The theory was picked up by the Federalist Party and played a key part of 1800 presidential race between President John Adams, a Federalist, and Vice President Thomas Jefferson, a Democratic-Republican. Rumors circulated among Federalists that Jefferson was an atheist who would hand America over to France if elected president. Jefferson did win, and the Federalists never fully recovered. Tales of the illuminati receded, but soon the Freemasons emerged to take their place in the wild imaginings of early Americans. The Freemasons counted many leading figures, including George Washington, as members. Their influence fueled whispers that suggested the fraternal organization was a satanic conspiracy bent on ruling the world. To understand why so many were convinced, it’s important to remember the anxiety that followed the American Revolution, said Jonathan Den Hartog, a historian at Samford University. Many people were unsure whether the country would last. “Living through this period, a lot of people were very nervous. And when there’s uncertainty and fear, people are going to cast about for explanations,” Den Hartog said. Both the Illuminati and the Freemasonscontinue to make appearances in conspiracy theories even today. The middle of the 19th century also saw thousands of Americans join new religious movements during the Second Great Awakening. One popular group, the Millerites, was founded by William Miller, a veteran of the War of 1812 who used numeric clues in the Bible to calculate the ending of the world: Oct. 22, 1844. Before the appointed day, many of Miller’s followers sold or gave away their possessions, donned white clothing and headed for high land — in some parts of Massachusetts they climbed trees on the highest hills — so as to hasten their reunion with God. When Oct. 22 passed, they came down from the hills. Some returned to their old lives. Others insisted the End had come, only invisibly. “It was called the ‘Great Disappointment,'” said J. Gordon Melton, a Baylor University historian and Millerite expert. “A lot of people were very disappointed — Miller included. But others just said, ‘Well, they just got the date wrong.’” In the News Alex Jones Oct 20, 2023 Judge rules Alex Jones can't use bankruptcy protection to avoid paying Sandy Hook families The belief that the world will soon end — or that a new era will dawn — shows up again and again in popular conspiracy theories. QAnon adherents have long predicted a “Great Awakening” that will occur, following “the storm,” when former President Trump triumphs and his enemies — including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and actor Tom Hanks — are exposed and possibly executed on television. Many dates have been suggested for this final, bloody victory, predictions that are later shrugged off when proved incorrect. In 2021, thousands of QAnon believers gathered in Dallas after one of their leaders predicted the return John F. Kennedy Jr., who features prominently in QAnon lore despite his death in 1999. Crestfallen believers later decided they had their dates wrong. Something similar happened late last year, when many conspiracy theorists claimed a long-planned test of the emergency broadcast system would activate chemicals contained within COVID-19 vaccines. Those who got the shot would be killed or perhaps turned into zombies, according to this thinking. It didn’t happen. The assassination of President John F. Kennedy, along with the Vietnam War and Watergate, later set the stage for our current era of “alternative facts” by convincing large groups of Americans that they could no longer trust their own government. Today’s conspiracy theories reflect that same distrust, and an unease with the rapid pace of economic, technological and environmental change. Think of claims that the 1969 moon landing was faked, that the government covered up evidence of extraterrestrials, or that the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were an inside job. Fears about 5G wireless towers or vaccines containing microchips, to use two newer examples, reflect fears of government control and new technologies. Claims that climate change is a lie offer an easy answer to a complicated, existential threat caused by people’s own behavior. Then there’s the coronavirus pandemic, which created ideal conditions for conspiracy theories: widespread fear and economic uncertainty, a deadly threat that emerged mysteriously from a geopolitical adversary, swiftly created vaccines, and a controversial government response. “COVID really cranked all the dials to 11,” said Joseph Uscinski, a University of Miami political scientist who studies belief in conspiracy theories. The internet has made belief in conspiracy theories more visible and shareable. Trump and other politicians have learned how to exploit belief in conspiracy theories for their own ends. But history shows America has withstood hoaxes, conspiracy theories and cycles of distrust before. Den Hartog, the Samford historian, said he would like to believe the nation can do it again. “This gives me some hope, to know that we’ve had problems and we weathered them,” he said. “There is an American capacity to take a breath, to try harder on our civic life and to rebuild trust.”",
